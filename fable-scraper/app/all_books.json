      "description": "Poet and filmmaker Gretel Ehrlich went to Wyoming in 1975 to make the first in a series of documentaries when her partner died. Ehrlich stayed on and found she couldn't leave. \n                    is a chronicle of her first years on \"the planet of Wyoming,\" a personal journey into a place, a feeling, and a way of life.\n   \n                    \n    \u00a0\n   \n                    \n    Ehrlich captures both the otherworldly beauty and cruelty of the natural forces\u2014the harsh wind, bitter cold, and swiftly changing seasons\u2014in the remote reaches of the American West. She brings depth, tenderness, and humor to her portraits of the peculiar souls who also call it home: hermits and ranchers, rodeo cowboys and schoolteachers, dreamers and realists. Together, these essays form an evocative and vibrant tribute to the life Ehrlich chose and the geography she loves.\n   \n                    \n    \u00a0\n   \n                    \n    Originally written as journal entries addressed to a friend, \n                    is raw, meditative, electrifying, and uncommonly wise. In prose \"as expansive as a Wyoming vista, as charged as a bolt of prairie lightning,\" Ehrlich explores the magical interplay between our interior lives and the world around us (\n                    ).",

      "description": "Thomas Mann's last great novel, first published in 1947 and now rendered into English by acclaimed translator John E. Woods, is a modern reworking of the Faust legend, in which Germany sells its soul to the Devil. Mann's protagonist, the composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn, is the flower of German culture, a brilliant, isolated, overreaching figure, his radical new music a breakneck game played by art at the very edge of impossibility. In return for twenty-four years of unparalleled musical accomplishment, he bargains away his soul - and the ability to love his fellow man.<br /><br />Leverk\u00fchn's life story is a brilliant allegory of the rise of the Third Reich, of Germany's renunciation of its own humanity and its embrace of ambition and its nihilism. It is also Mann's most profound meditation on the German genius - both national and individual - and the terrible responsibilities of the truly great artist.",

      "description": "In his philosophical reflections on the art of lingering, acclaimed cultural theorist Byung-Chul Han argues that the value we attach today to the vita activa is producing a crisis in our sense of time.  Our attachment to the vita activa creates an imperative to work which degrades the human being into a labouring animal, an animal laborans. At the same time, the hyperactivity which characterizes our daily routines robs human beings of the capacity to linger and the faculty of contemplation.  It therefore becomes impossible to experience time as fulfilling. Drawing on a range of thinkers including Heidegger, Nietzsche and Arendt, Han argues that we can overcome this temporal crisis only by revitalizing the vita contemplativa and relearning the art of lingering. For what distinguishes humans from other animals is the capacity for reflection and contemplation, and when life regains this capacity, this art of lingering, it gains in time and space, in duration and vastness.",

      "description": "Why do men so often act as if they were split in two - like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde - and why do even \"good\" men display behavior that hurts others? John Stoltenberg provides inspiring new answers, exploring such issues as male anxiety about the judgments of other men and the secret social truces by which men validate each other's manhood. Filled with dramatic surprises, emotional intimacies, and playful wit, The End of Manhood offers a bold new model of sexual and personal identity for any male who truly wants to become his best self and live as a man of conscience. In a trenchant challenge to the gurus of \"deep masculinity,\" Stoltenberg argues that embracing myths to get in touch with manhood is futile - because manhood is the biggest myth of all. Rebutting their cultist devotion to manhood with a realistic vision of gender justice, he shows exactly how men of conscience can put his powerful wisdom to work in every aspect of their lives - in love, in sex, in families, among friends. With unblinking candor, stirring conviction, and often biting humor, the author leads readers step-by-step toward personal recognitions that provide a meaningful way out of the manhood sham. In the astonishing last four chapters - written in a rogues' gallery of voices at once ribald and apocalyptic - Stoltenberg exposes the sexual subtexts of manhood run amuck: sexual objectification, male bonding, homophobia, and pornography. Only then, in the Epilog, can this book's profound vision of human self-actualization be at last fully revealed. No one who has been raised to be a man will think about his life the same way after reading this practical and prophetic book. It articulates men's clear-cut choice between believing in the myth of manhood or affirming everyone's sovereign selfhood, between marching in lockstep with other men's gender anxieties or following the beat of one's honestly human heart, between living the lie of manhood or living a life of loving justice.

Often scorned by neighbors for her family&#8217;s erratic and eccentric behavior&#8212;such as her father Johnny&#8217;s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy&#8217;s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce&#8212;no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans&#8217; life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans&#8217; daily experiences are tenderly threaded with family connectedness and raw with honesty.

Le Guin&#8217;s magnificent work of imagination, a visionary, genre-crossing story about a future utopian community on the Northern California coast, hailed as &#8220;masterly&#8221; (<em>Newsweek</em>), &#8220;hypnotic&#8221; (<em>People</em>) and &#8220;[her] most consistently lyric and luminous book&#8221; (<em>New York Times). </em>This new edition features an introduction by Shruti Swamy, author of <em>A House is a Body, </em>as well as extra material<em> </em>that includes interviews and liner notes to the book's musical soundtrack. </strong></p><p>Midway through her career, Le Guin embarked on one of her most detailed, impressive literary projects, a novel that took more than five years to complete. Blending story and fable, poetry, artwork, and song,&#160;<em>Always Coming Home</em>&#160;is this legendary writer&#8217;s fictional&#160;ethnography of the Kesh, a people of the far future living in a post-apocalyptic Napa Valley.</p><p>Having survived ecological catastrophe brought on by relentless industrialization, the Kesh are a peaceful people who reject governance and the constriction of genders, limit population growth to prevent overcrowding and preserve resources, and maintain a healthy community in which everyone works to contribute to its well-being. This richly imagined story unfolds through a series of narrated &#8220;translations&#8221; that illuminate individual lives, including a woman named Stone Telling, who travels beyond the Valley and comes to reside with another tribe, the patriarchal Condor people. With sharp poignancy, Le Guin explores the complexities of the Kesh&#8217;s unified society and presents to us&#8212;in exquisite detail&#8212;their lives, histories, adventures, customs, language, and art.&#160;</p><p>In addition to poems and folk tales, Le Guin created verse dramas, records of oral performances, recipes, and even an alphabet and glossary of the Kesh language. The novel is illustrated throughout with drawings by artist Margaret Chodos and includes a musical component&#8212;original recordings of Kesh songs that Le Guin collaborated on with composer Todd Barton&#8212;bringing this utterly original and compelling world to life.</p>",

      "description": "At the age of 14  Georg Koves is plucked from his home in a Jewish section of Budapest and without any particular malice, placed on a train to Auschwitz. He does not understand the reason for his fate. He doesn&#8217;t particularly think of himself as Jewish. And his fellow prisoners, who decry his lack of Yiddish, keep telling him, &#8220;You are no Jew.&#8221; In the lowest circle of the Holocaust, Georg remains an outsider. <br>The genius of Imre Kertesz&#8217;s unblinking novel lies in its refusal to mitigate the  strangeness of its events, not least of which is Georg&#8217;s dogmatic insistence on making sense of what he witnesses&#8211;or pretending that what he witnesses makes sense. Haunting, evocative, and all the more horrifying for its rigorous avoidance of sentiment, <b>Fatelessness</b><i> </i>is a masterpiece in the traditions of Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, and Tadeusz Borowski.",

In The Divide, Jason Hickel brilliantly lays it out, layer upon layer, until you are left reeling with the outrage of it all. - Kate Raworth, author of Doughnut Economics The richest eight people control more wealth than the poorest half of the world combined. Today, 60 per cent of the worlds population lives on less than $5 a day. Though global real GDP has nearly tripled since 1980, 1.1 billion more people are now living in poverty.For decades we have been told a that development is working, that poverty is a natural phenomenon and will be eradicated through aid by 2030. But just because it is a comforting tale doesnt make it true. Poor countries are poor because they are integrated into the global economic system on unequal terms, and aid only helps to hide this. Drawing on pioneering research and years of first-hand experience, The Divide tracks the evolution of global inequality from the expeditions of Christopher Columbus to the present day offering revelatory answers to some of humanitys greatest problems. It is a provocative, urgent and ultimately uplifting account of how the world works, and how it can change for the better.",

      "description": "What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.<br /><br />Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality\u2014the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth\u2014today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.",

People still reeling from catastrophe were being hit again, this time with economic \"shock treatment,\" losing their land and homes to rapid-fire corporate makeovers.<br><br><i>The Shock Doctrine</i> retells the story of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman's free market economic revolution. In contrast to the popular myth of this movement's peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies in so many parts of the world from Latin America and Eastern Europe to South Africa, Russia, and Iraq.<br><br>At the core of disaster capitalism is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. Klein argues that by capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, and is the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.</p>",

It dominates our decision-making for the future, guides multi-billion-dollar investments, and shapes our responses to climate change, inequality, and other environmental and social challenges that define our times.<br><br>Pity then, or more like disaster, that its fundamental ideas are centuries out of date yet are still taught in college courses worldwide and still used to address critical issues in government and business alike.<br><br>That&rsquo;s why it is time, says renegade economist Kate Raworth, to revise our economic thinking for the 21st century. In <i>Doughnut Economics,</i> she sets out 7 key ways to fundamentally reframe our understanding of what economics is and does. Along the way, she points out how we can break our addiction to growth; redesign money, finance, and business to be in service to people; and create economies that are regenerative and distributive by design.<br><br>Named after the now-iconic &ldquo;doughnut&rdquo; image that Raworth first drew to depict a sweet spot of human prosperity (an image that appealed to the Occupy Movement, the United Nations, eco-activists, and business leaders alike), <i>Doughnut Economics</i> offers a radically new compass for guiding global development, government policy, and corporate strategy, and sets new standards for what economic success looks like.<br><br>Raworth handpicks the best emergent ideas&mdash;from ecological, behavioral, feminist, and institutional economics to complexity thinking and Earth-systems science&mdash;to address this question: How can we turn economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive, into economies that make us thrive, whether or not they grow?<br><br>Simple, playful, and eloquent, <i>Doughnut Economics</i> offers game-changing analysis and inspiration for a new generation of economic thinkers.<br><br><b>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sustainability in all things&rsquo; should be our species&rsquo; philosophy; the Doughnut Model our compass for the journey.&rdquo; &mdash;Sir David Attenborough</b><br><br><b>&ldquo;Shows how to ensure dignity and prosperity for all people.&rdquo;<i> &mdash;Huffington Post</i></b>",

Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang&mdash;in a revolution or military coup&mdash;but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one. <br><br>Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die.

Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works\u2014in real-world terms. Writing with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history, and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks.<br /><br />Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline,\u00a0Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why\u00a0 there is no one way to explain economic behavior. Instead, by ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics. From the future of the Euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States\u2014<i>Economics: The User\u2019s Guide</i> is a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives.",

Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.<br /><br />Powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal Japan, <i>Sh</i><i>\u014d</i><i>gun</i> is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book. Heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action melds seamlessly with intricate historical detail and raw human emotion. Endlessly compelling, this sweeping saga captivated the world to become not only one of the best-selling novels of all time but also one of the highest-rated television miniseries, as well as inspiring a nationwide surge of interest in the culture of Japan. Shakespearean in both scope and depth, <i>Sh</i><i>\u014d</i><i>gun</i> is, as the <i>New York Times</i> put it, \"...not only something you read--you live it.\" Provocative, absorbing, and endlessly fascinating, there is only one: <i>Sh</i><i>\u014d</i><i>gun.</i>",

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity.&#160;A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man&rsquo;s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman&rsquo;s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.&#160;At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck&rsquo;s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.<br><br> This Centennial edition, specially designed to commemorate one hundred years of Steinbeck, features french flaps and deckle-edged pages.<br><br> For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

          "biography": "<p><b>John Steinbeck </b>(1902&ndash;1968), born in Salinas, California, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929).<br> &#160;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&rsquo;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &#160;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1948), another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950), and <i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&rsquo;s history.<br> &#160;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1989).<br> &#160;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America&rsquo;s greatest writers and cultural figures.&#160;<br><br> <b>Robert DeMott </b>(editor/introduction) is the Edwin and Ruth Kennedy Distinguished Professor at Ohio State University and author of <i>Steinbeck's Typewriter</i>, an award-winning book of critical essays.</p>",

      "description": "SHORTLISTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE \u2022 By the New York Times bestselling author of The Bone Clocks. . .<br/><br/>A postmodern visionary and one of the leading voices in twenty-first-century fiction, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian love of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending, philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. In this groundbreaking novel, an influential favorite among a new generation of writers, Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . . Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.<br/><br/>But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.<br/><br/>As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.",

But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.<BR /><BR /> Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.<BR /><BR /> But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.<BR /><BR /> With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man&#39;s world.<BR /><BR /><B>#1 <I>New York Times</I> Bestseller -- named one of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, the <I>Washington Post</I>, <I>People</I>, <I>Time</I>, Amazon, <I>Entertainment Weekly</I>, <I>Bustle<I>, <I>Newsweek</I>, the A.V.

In the frontier lands known as the Roughs, the old magics are a crucial tool for those who establish order and justice.<br><br>One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. After twenty years in the Roughs, tragedy has driven Wax back to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties of the head of a noble house. But when a gang of Allomancers turn to train robbery and kidnapping, Wax will soon learn that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.<br><br><b>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson</b><br><br><b><u>The Cosmere</u></b><br><br><b>The Stormlight Archive</b><br><i>The Way of Kings</i><br><i>Words of Radiance</i><br><i>Edgedancer </i>(novella)<br><i>Oathbringer</i><br><i>Dawnshard </i>(novella)<br><i>Rhythm of War</i><br><br><b>The Mistborn Saga</b><br><b>The Original Trilogy</b><br><i>Mistborn</i><br><i>The Well of Ascension</i><br><i>The Hero of Ages</i><br><br><b>Wax and Wayne</b><br><i>The Alloy of Law</i><br><i>Shadows of Self</i><br><i>The Bands of Mourning</i><br><i>The Lost Metal</i><br><br><b>Other Cosmere novels</b><br><i>Elantris</i><br><i>Warbreaker</i><br><i>Tress of the Emerald Sea</i><br><i>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</i><br><i>The Sunlit Man</i><br><br><b>Collection</b><br><i>Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection</i><br><br><b><u>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series</u></b><br><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i><br><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i><br><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i><br><i>The Shattered Lens</i><br><i>The Dark Talent</i><br><i>Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians </i>(with Janci Patterson)<br><br><b>Other novels</b><br><i>The Rithmatist</i><br><i>Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds</i><br><i>The Frugal Wizard\u2019s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England</i><br><br><b>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</b><br><br><b><u>The Reckoners</u></b><br><i>Steelheart</i><br><i>Firefight</i><br><i>Calamity</i><br><br><b><u>Skyward</u></b><br><i>Skyward</i><br><i>Starsight</i><br><i>Cytonic</i><br><i>Skyward Flight</i> (with Janci Patterson)<br><i>Defiant</i><br><br>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>",

Why is the enemy of memory not time but other memories? How can a blind person learn to see with her tongue, or a deaf person learn to hear with his skin?

A \ufb02eet of space probes are continually beaming data from their sensors back to Earth. Hidden in this stream of code are startling new discoveries about the worlds we share with the Sun. We will piece together these remarkable and often surprising \ufb01ndings to tell the greatest science story of them all \u2013 the life and times of the Solar System.<br /><br /><br />What emerges is a dramatic tale chronicling the adventures of eight planetary siblings. Born from violence, they grow up together, in time becoming living and breathing worlds, only to fade away one by one as they age. Along the way each world takes on its own unique character which we will come to know as we cross the vastness of space and time to visit them. We\u2019ll place our cameras on the surfaces of these worlds at moments of heightened drama. We\u2019ll give readers a glimpse of the most memorable moments in the evolution of our star system.<br /><br /><br />Along the way we will meet all eight of the major planets, plus a supporting cast of moons, asteroids and comets, and a mysterious as yet unseen world way out beyond the Kuiper belt\u2026",

I suspect his book will do the same for you.&rdquo; &#8212;Bill Gates</b><BR> <BR><b>A <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and international sensation, this &ldquo;stimulating and important book&rdquo; (<i>Financial Times</i>) is a fascinating dive into the purpose and power of slumber.</b><BR><BR>With two appearances on <i>CBS This Morning </i>and <i>Fresh Air</i>'s most popular interview of 2017, Matthew Walker has made abundantly clear that sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when it is absent. Compared to the other basic drives in life&#8212;eating, drinking, and reproducing&#8212;the purpose of sleep remains more elusive.<BR> <BR> Within the brain, sleep enriches a diversity of functions, including our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity.<BR> <BR> In this &ldquo;compelling and utterly convincing&rdquo; (<i>The Sunday Times</i>) book, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it affects every aspect of our physical and mental well-being. Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity. He also provides actionable steps towards getting a better night&rsquo;s sleep every night.<BR> <BR> Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, <i>Why We Sleep</i> is a crucial and illuminating book. Written with the precision of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Sherwin Nuland, it is &ldquo;recommended for night-table reading in the most pragmatic sense&rdquo; (<i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i>).",

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. <br><br>In <i>The Sixth Extinction</i>, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. <br><br>Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</p>",

Yet rather than taking a realistic approach to what aliens might be like, we imagine that life on other planets is the stuff of science fiction. The time has come to abandon our fantasies of space invaders and movie monsters and place our expectations on solid scientific footing.<br><br>But short of aliens landing in New York City, how do we know what they are like? Using his own expert understanding of life on Earth and Darwin's theory of evolution--which applies throughout the universe--Cambridge zoologist Dr. Arik Kershenbaum explains what alien life must be like: how these creatures will move, socialize, and communicate. For example, by observing fish whose electrical pulses indicate social status, we can see that other planets might allow for communication by electricity. As there was evolutionary pressure to wriggle along a sea floor, Earthling animals tend to have left/right symmetry; on planets where creatures evolved in midair or in soupy tar, they might be lacking any symmetry at all.<br><br>Might there be an alien planet with supersonic animals? A moon where creatures have a language composed of smells? Will aliens scream with fear, act honestly, or have technology? <i>The Zoologist's Guide to the Galaxy </i>answers these questions using the latest science to tell the story of how life really works, on Earth and in space.",

In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.",

Wohlleben also shares his deep love of woods and forests, explaining the amazing processes of life, death, and regeneration that he has observed in his woodland.<br><br>&#8220;A declaration of love and an engrossing primer on trees, brimming with facts and an unashamed awe for nature.&#8221;<b><i>&#8212;Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#8220;Heavily dusted with the glitter of wonderment.&#8221;<b><i>&#8212;The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>Includes a Note From a Forest Scientist by Dr.Suzanne Simard<br><br><b>Published in Partnership with the David Suzuki Institute</b><br><br>",

      "description": "In November 1910, a ship called <em>Terra Nova</em> left New Zealand on its way south to Antarctica. On board was an international team of explorers led by Robert Falcon Scott, a man determined to be the first to reach the South Pole. A year and a half later, Scott and three members of his team died during a brutal blizzard. Their dream of reaching the Pole first had already been dashed by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, and now on their return trip--slowed by ill health and bad weather--Scott's party found themselves trapped in a tent without sufficient provisions, while the wind howled endlessly outside. Even in his final hours, Scott found the strength to continue the journal he'd started at the beginning of his adventures; the diary was found beside his frozen body.<br /><br /><em>Scott's Last Expedition: The Journals</em> is the explorer's detailed account of his time in Antarctica. The team's daily progress towards their final goal is recorded in Scott's vivid, personal narrative, as well as his impressions of the harsh conditions, the stark beauty of the tundra, and his own increasingly desperate ambition to beat his rivals to the Pole. Shortly before he died, Scott wrote: \"Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman.\" Robert Falcon Scott and his men died, but their story lives on in his journals.",

      "description": "In the Metaporhosis, the German novelist Franz Kafka warns that capitalism harbours inevitable changes that will result ultimately in loneliness and horror. He does so with a prophecy that women will replace men in the 20th-century workforce, to their detriment. The Metamorphosis deals with an absurd, or wildly irrational, event, which in itself suggests that the story operates in a random, chaotic universe. The absurd event is Gregor's waking up to discover he has turned into a giant insect, and since it's so far beyond the boundaries of a natural occurrence, Gregor's metamorphosis takes on a supernatural significance. Throughout ?The Metamorphosis, industrialism is expressed in a precise technical writing style using the themes of work, buying power, and dehumanisation through working too much. All this makes the story seem very factory-like as it warns us to find meaning aside from work and to beware victimisation, parasitic relationships, and abusers. However, these are exactly the issues we face today.",

His work, which fuses elements of realism and unbelievable, typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best-known works include The Metamorphosis, The Trial, and The Castle. Born on July 3, 1883, in Prague, capital of what is now the Czech Republic, writer Franz Kafka grew up in an upper middle-class Jewish family. After studying law at the University of Prague, he worked in insurance and wrote in the evenings. In his literature, Kafka's characters were often coming up against an overbearing power of some kind, one that could easily break the will of men and destroy their sense of self-worth.Kafka seems to have derived much of his value directly from his family, in particular his father.",

Jemisin.&#8221; -- Booknest</strong></p><p>From #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Babel</em> and <em>Yellowface</em>, the brilliantly imaginative debut of R.F. Kuang: an epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China&#8217;s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu&#8217;s <em>Grace of Kings</em> and N.K. Jemisin&#8217;s Inheritance Trilogy.</p><p>When Rin aced the Keju&#8212;the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies&#8212;it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn&#8217;t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin&#8217;s guardians, who believed they&#8217;d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard&#8212;the most elite military school in Nikan&#8212;was even more surprising.</p><p>But surprises aren&#8217;t always good.</p><p>Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power&#8212;an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive&#8212;and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.</p><p>For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .</p><p>Rin&#8217;s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.</p>",

What makes them powerful? The reason why so many of us binge Manson documentaries by the dozen and fall down rabbit holes researching suburban moms gone QAnon is because we&#8217;re looking for a satisfying explanation for what causes people to join&#8212;and more importantly, stay in&#8212;extreme groups. We secretly want to know: could it happen to me? Amanda Montell&#8217;s argument is that, on some level, it already has . . .</p><p>Our culture tends to provide pretty flimsy answers to questions of cult influence, mostly having to do with vague talk of &#8220;brainwashing.&#8221; But the true answer has nothing to do with freaky mind-control wizardry or Kool-Aid. In Cultish, Montell argues that the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them attitudes all comes down to language. In both positive ways and shadowy ones, cultish language is something we hear&#8212;and are influenced by&#8212;every single day.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Through juicy storytelling and cutting original research, Montell exposes the verbal elements that make a wide spectrum of communities &#8220;cultish,&#8221; revealing how they affect followers of groups as notorious as Heaven&#8217;s Gate, but also how they pervade our modern start-ups, Peloton leaderboards, and Instagram feeds. Incisive and darkly funny, this enrapturing take on the curious social science of power and belief will make you hear the fanatical language of &#8220;cultish&#8221; everywhere.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Vast legions of gods, mages, humans, dragons and all manner of creatures play out the fate of the Malazan Empire in this first book in a major epic fantasy series from Steven Erikson.</b><br><br>The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. <br><br>For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze. <br><br>However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand... <br><br>Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, <i>Gardens of the Moon </i>is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling adventure by an outstanding new voice.<br><br>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>",

      "description": "First published in 1924 in German, \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d is the thoughtful and introspective novel by Nobel Prize laureate Thomas Mann. Widely regarded as one of the most important modern works of the 20th century, Mann\u2019s story follows the aristocratic Hans Castorp as he leaves his comfortable family home to visit his ailing friend in a distant sanatorium located high in the Swiss Alps. Castorp\u2019s stay begins as a brief vacation before he starts his adult life as an engineer in Germany and evolves into several years spent in this isolated institution recovering from a newly discovered illness. Castorp meets a fascinating cast of characters in his mountain retreat, including anarchists, socialists, and royalty, as he attempts to find meaning in his life. In a work acclaimed as both philosophical and deeply profound, Castorp and his fellow patients have little to do but consider their lives and fill their seemingly endless days with reflection and debate while the rest of Europe marches towards a world war. \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d is a thought-provoking work that grapples with the eternal human concerns of love, money, politics, and the inexorable passage of time. This edition follows the translation of Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter.",

      "description": "\u201cCarmilla\u201d is the 1872 Gothic vampire novella by Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, a leading writer of ghost tales and horror fiction of the Victorian era. His haunting and surprisingly modern \u201cCarmilla\u201d was one of the first works in the vampire fiction genre and was written decades before the publication of Bram Stroker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d in 1897. Le Fanu\u2019s story has been widely influential and is notable for its depiction of homosexual desire between the female vampire and her beautiful, young victims. \u201cCarmilla\u201d is told from the perspective of a case study by Dr. Hesselius, a medical doctor who investigates occult phenomenon. The central character is Laura, a teenager living alone with her retired father in lonely castle in the forests of Austria. Laura longs for a friend her own age and, not coincidentally, a carriage accident brings the lovely and seemingly young Carmilla to Laura\u2019s home. Before long Laura\u2019s health declines and she is haunted by nightmares as she becomes the latest victim of the vampire Carmilla. To save her, Laura\u2019s father must battle the cunning and evil vampire for her life and soul. Frightening, entertaining, and hauntingly romantic, Le Fanu\u2019s Gothic adventure remains a classic of vampire literature. This edition includes a biographical afterword.",

Caught in one feud too many, he's on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian -- leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. <br><br>Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. <br><br>Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box.

A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult. <br><br> Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. <br><br><B>Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable characters, <I>The Blade Itself</I> is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.",

      "description": "Chromophobia - a fear of corruption or contamination through colour - has lurked within Western culture since ancient times. This is apparent in the many attempts to purge colour from art, literature and architecture, either by making it the property of some \"foreign\" body - the oriental, the feminine, the infantile the vulgar or the pathological - or by relegating it to the realm of the superficial, the inessential or the cosmetic, which in many cases amounts to the same thing. In <i>Chromophobia</i>, David Batchelor analyzes the history of, and motivations behind, chromophobia, from its beginnings through examples of nineteenth-century literature, twentieth-century architecture and film, to Pop art, minimalism and the art and architecture of the present day. Batchelor suggests how colour fits, or fails to fit, into the cultural imagination of the West, exploring such diverse themes as Melville's \"great white whale,\" Le Corbusier's \"journey to the East,\" Huxley's experiments with mescaline. Dorothy's travels in the Land of Oz and the implication of modern artists' experiments with industrial paints and materials.",

      "description": "More than seventy years ago, American forces exploded the first atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing great physical and human destruction. The young scientists at Los Alamos who developed the bombs, which were nicknamed Little Boy and Fat Man, were introduced to the basic principles and goals of the project in March 1943, at a crash course in new weapons technology. The lecturer was physicist Robert Serber, J. Robert Oppenheimer&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the scientists learned that their job was to design and build the world&rsquo;s first atomic bombs. Notes on Serber&rsquo;s lectures were gathered into a mimeographed document titled <I>The</I><I>Los Alamos Primer,</I> which was supplied to all incoming scientific staff. The <I>Primer </I>remained classified for decades after the war.<BR /><BR /> Published for the first time in 1992, the <I>Primer </I>offers contemporary readers a better understanding of the origins of nuclear weapons. Serber&rsquo;s preface vividly conveys the mingled excitement, uncertainty, and intensity felt by the Manhattan Project scientists. This edition includes an updated introduction by Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning historian Richard Rhodes.<BR /><BR /> A seminal publication on a turning point in human history, <I>The Los Alamos Primer</I> reveals just how much was known and how terrifyingly much was unknown midway through the Manhattan Project.

      "description": "Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>d\u00e6mon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had d\u00e6mons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is \"clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war.\" But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her d\u00e6mon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey d\u00e6mon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from \"gyptians\" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>",

      "description": "The year is 1806. England is beleaguered by the long war with Napoleon, and centuries have passed since practical magicians faded into the nation's past. But scholars of this glorious history discover that one remains: the reclusive Mr Norrell, whose displays of magic send a thrill through the country. \r\n\r\nProceeding to London, he raises a beautiful woman from the dead and summons an army of ghostly ships to terrify the French. Yet the cautious, fussy Norrell is challenged by the emergence of another magician: the brilliant novice Jonathan Strange. \r\n\r\nYoung, handsome and daring, Strange is the very antithesis of Norrel. So begins a dangerous battle between these two great men which overwhelms that between England and France. And their own obsessions and secret dabblings with the dark arts are going to cause more trouble than they can imagine.",

      "description": "<b>#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER &bull; The epic account of the storm on the summit of Mt. Everest that claimed five lives and left countless more&mdash;including Krakauer's&mdash;in guilt-ridden disarray. <br></b><br><b>&ldquo;A harrowing tale of the perils of high-altitude climbing, a story of bad luck and worse judgment and of heartbreaking heroism.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>People</i></b><br><br><b>A <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Best Nonfiction Book of the Last 30 Years</b><br><br>A bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that &ldquo;suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down.&rdquo; He was wrong. <br><br>By writing <i>Into Thin Air</i>, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer's highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber's death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself. <br><br>This updated trade paperback edition of <i>Into Thin Air</i> includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy. \"I have no doubt that Boukreev's intentions were good on summit day,\" writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. \"What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev's refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn't the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients.\" As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since <i>Into Thin Air</i>'s denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer's tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored <i>The Climb</i>, Boukreev's version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer recounts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I. <br><br>In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters--a prestigious prize intended \"to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment.\" According to the Academy's citation, \"Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind.\"",

      "description": "<b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER &bull; In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. This is the unforgettable story of h<b>ow&#160;Christopher Johnson McCandless&#160;came to die.<br><br>\"It may be nonfiction, but <i>Into the Wild</i> is a mystery of the highest order.\" <i>&mdash;Entertainment Weekly</i><br></b></b><br>McCandess had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Not long after, he was dead. <i>Into the Wild </i>is the mesmerizing, heartbreaking tale of an enigmatic young man who goes missing in the wild and whose story captured the world&rsquo;s attention.&#160;<br><br>Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.<br><br>Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interest that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the drives and desires that propelled McCandless.&#160;<br><br>When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naivet&eacute;, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding&mdash;and not an ounce of sentimentality. <i>Into the Wild</i> is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.",

      "description": "<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;love&#8217; is most often defined as a noun, yet...we would all love to better if we used it as a verb,&#8221; writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in <em>All About Love</em>. Here, at her most provacative, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness. <p></p>As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explode th question &#8220;What is love?&#8221; her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society&#8217;s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. <p></p><em>The Utne Reader</em> declared bell hooks one of the &#8220;100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.&#8221;<p></p>",

It&rsquo;s gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful&rdquo; (San Francisco Chronicle).</b><br><br><b>One of The New York Times&rsquo;s 100 Best Books of the 21st Century &bull; A <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>Best Fiction Book of the Century</b><br><br>A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don&rsquo;t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food&mdash;and each other.<br><br><i>The Road</i> is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, &ldquo;each the other&rsquo;s world entire,&rdquo; are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.",

But mushrooms are only fruiting bodies, analogous to apples on a tree. Most fungi live out of sight, yet make up a massively diverse kingdom of organisms that supports and sustains nearly all living systems. Fungi provide a key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel, and behave.<br><br>In the first edition of this mind-bending book, Sheldrake introduced us to this mysterious but massively diverse kingdom of life. This exquisitely designed volume, abridged from the original, features more than one hundred full-color images that bring the spectacular variety, strangeness, and beauty of fungi to life as never before.<br><br>Fungi throw our concepts of individuality and even intelligence into question. They are metabolic masters, earth makers, and key players in most of life&rsquo;s processes. They can change our minds, heal our bodies, and even help us remediate environmental disaster. By examining fungi on their own terms, Sheldrake reveals how these extraordinary organisms&mdash;and our relationships with them&mdash;are changing our understanding of how life works.<br><br><b>Winner of the Wainwright Prize, the Royal Society Science Book Prize, and the Guild of Food Writers Award &bull; Shortlisted for the British Book Award &bull; Longlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize</b>",

      "description": "1984 or Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949. 1984 is one of George Orwell's most powerful politically charged novels, a beautifully crafted warning against the dangers of a totalitarian society, and one of the most famous novels in the dystopian genre. Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling party in London whose every move is monitored by telescreens. Everywhere Winston goes, the party's omniscient leader, Big Brother, watches him. This is an important novel not only for its stark warning against abusive authority (and its somewhat ironic contribution to modern television content), but also for its insights into the power of manipulating language, history, and the psychology of fear and control. These issues are perhaps even more pertinent today than when Orwell penned his novel.",

Amidst his desolation, he encounters a captivating young woman with whom he forms a deep emotional connection. As their bond intensifies, the young man finds himself entranced by the allure of love, yet his affection remains unreciprocated. The woman, consumed by thoughts of her absent lover, cannot return his feelings. Potent and profound, <em>White Nights</em> explores the universal themes of unrequited love, longing, and the ache of loneliness. The bittersweet nature of the tale and its insights into the human heart render it a deeply poignant and unforgettable work of literature.

The narrator's plane has crashed there and he has scarcely some food and water to survive. Trying to comprehend what caused the crash, the Little Prince appears. The serious blonde little boy asks to draw him a sheep. The narrator consents to the strange fellow's request. They soon become friends and the Little Prince informs the pilot that he is from a small planet, the asteroid 325, talks to him about the baobabs, his planet volcanoes and the mysterious rose that grew on his planet. He also talks to him about their friendship and the lie that evoked his journey to other planets. Often puzzled by the grown-ups' behavior, the little traveler becomes a total and eternal symbol of innocence and love, of responsibility and devotion. Through him we get to see how insightful children are and how grown-ups aren't. Children use their heart to feel what's really important, not the eyes.Heart-breaking, funny and thought-provoking, it is an enchanting and endlessly wise fable about the human condition and the power of imagination. A book about both childhood and adulthood, it can be read as a parable, a war story, a classic children's fairy-tale, and many more things besides: The Little Prince is a book for everyone; after all, all grown-ups were children once.</p><p><strong>Top 10 ebooks by General Press:</strong></p><p>\u25cf Animal Farm 9789387669611</p><p>\u25cf As I Lay Dying 9789389716085</p><p>\u25cf Great Expectations 9788180320019</p><p>\u25cf The Complete Sherlock Holmes 9788180320484</p><p>\u25cf The Complete Works of Charles Dickens (Illustrated Edition) 9788180320071</p><p>\u25cf The Complete Works of Kahlil Gibran 9789380914800</p><p>\u25cf The Complete Works of Rudyard Kipling 9788180320835</p><p>\u25cf The Little Prince 9789387669666</p><p>\u25cf The Plague 9789389716900</p><p>\u25cf The Stranger 9789389716917</p>",

Those who remain covet any living creature, and for people who can&rsquo;t afford one, companies built incredibly realistic simulacra: horses, birds, cats, sheep. They&rsquo;ve even built humans. Immigrants to Mars receive androids so sophisticated they are indistinguishable from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans can wreak, the government bans them from Earth. Driven into hiding, unauthorized androids live among human beings, undetected. Rick Deckard, an officially sanctioned bounty hunter, is commissioned to find rogue androids and &ldquo;retire&rdquo; them.
